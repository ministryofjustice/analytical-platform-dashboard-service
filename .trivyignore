# linux-libc-dev (kernel headers)
# These CVEs are in the Linux kernel, not the container. linux-libc-dev only provides
# header files for compilation - the actual kernel runs on the Kubernetes node host.
# Container isolation (seccomp, namespaces, capabilities) prevents exploitation.
# The host kernel is patched separately by the platform/infrastructure team.
